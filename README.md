# Milestone-1

This project develops an LLM-powered ingredient substitution system to simplify cooking by providing context-aware, ranked substitutes for missing ingredients. Using a fine-tuned large language model (LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct), the system helps users adapt recipes based on dietary needs, available ingredients, and culinary preferences -reducing food waste while saving time. Designed for busy professionals, health-conscious individuals, and cultural enthusiasts, Laddaty merges AI precision with human oversight to create a seamless cooking experience. Success is measured through key metrics, including Hit@k (substitution accuracy), user satisfaction, and customer retention rate (CRR).<br><br>
