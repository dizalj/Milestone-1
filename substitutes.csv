acorn,1 pound hazelnut,"The category is: Nuts. These nuts come from oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native Americans.   Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them.   To do this, boil whole shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color.   Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.  Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat:  tank, not bowl).  Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed.  This may discolor the toilet, however.  After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350° oven for about an hour.  They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.

African bird pepper,1 tablespoon cayenne pepper dried,The category is: African Spices. This is the North African equivalent of our cayenne pepper.,1 tablespoon African bird pepper
agar,1 tablespoon gelatin,"The category is: Gelatins. Since gelatin is made from animal tissue, many vegetarians rely upon this seaweed derivative as a substitute.  Like ordinary gelatin, agar is flavorless and becomes gelatinous when it's dissolved in water, heated, and then cooled.   Agar, though, gels more firmly than gelatin, and it sets and melts at a higher temperature--it can even set at room temperature.  Agar, like gelatin, is full of protein (though incomplete), but it also contains the rich array of minerals one would expect from seaweed.   To use agar, just soak it in the liquid for about 15 minutes, bring it to a gentle boil, then simmer while stirring until it's completely dissolved.  The liquid will gel as it cools.  Acids weakens agar's gelling power, so if you're firming an acidic liquid, use more.  Like gelatin, agar will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs.  Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes.  If you plan to add any of these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's a good idea to buy them in cans, since all canned fruit is pre-cooked.

baking soda,1 tablespoon potassium bicarbonate,"The category is: Other Leavens. Baking soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, it reacts and releases bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles, when trapped inside batter, help baked goods rise.  Baking powder contains baking soda, along with acidic salts that react with the soda when they get wet or heated.   Recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda are probably using the baking soda to offset extra acidity in the batter (from ingredients like buttermilk or molasses) and to weaken the proteins in the flour.  Omitting the baking soda from these recipes may alter the color or flavor of whatever you're baking, and make it less tender.
Tips: Baking soda is used in devil's food cake because it turns the cocoa powder reddish brown.  
Vegetables cooked in water mixed with baking soda don't lose as much color, though the baking soda makes them mushier and causes them to lose vitamin C.

Most are made to taste something like popular milk-based cheeses like Cheddar, Mozzarella, Gouda, American, Provolone, and Jack.Cheese substitutes are blander and more rubbery than real cheeses, but many brands melt fairly well in cooked dishes, especially if grated first. Fake mozzarella comes closest in flavor and texture to the real deal.Fake cheese often contains casein or caseinates, which are derived from milk. These kinds of cheeses won't pass muster with many vegans, but they're a good choice for people trying to restrict their consumption of cholesterol and lactose.Strict vegans should seek out cheeses labeled ""vegan"" or ""dairy-free.""

Chocolate,1 pound white chocolate,"The category is: Chocolate. Chocolate is made from tropical cacao beans, which are transformed by machines and an inveterate spelling error into a bitter, brown paste of cocoa butter and cocoa solids.  When this unsweetened chocolate is combined with sugar, vanilla, and other ingredients, the result, of course, is heavenly.

Chocolate's notoriously hard to work with.  If you don't store it properly (preferably at 65° or so), the cocoa butter can separate slightly from the solids, causing the chocolate to ""bloom.""  This leaves a telltale gray residue on the surface and impairs the taste and texture slightly.   Chocolate will scorch if you melt it at too high a temperature, or ""seize"" and become thick and grainy if you add even a drop of cold liquid to it as it's melting.  You can prevent it from seizing by adding hot liquids (like cream) to chopped chocolate in order to melt it, or by making sure that anything you're dipping into the melted chocolate (like a strawberry or whisk) is perfectly dry.  If your chocolate has seized, you can still use it in any recipe that calls for chocolate to be blended with a liquid.  Just add the liquid to the chocolate and melt it again.  

If you plan to melt chocolate, it's best to buy it in bars.  Chips contain less cocoa butter so that they can better hold their shape in cookies, but this makes them harder to melt and less tasty.  It's easiest to melt chocolate in a microwave oven.  Just break the chocolate into small pieces, heat it for 30 seconds at 50% power, stir, then repeat a few times.  Take it out of the microwave when the chocolate is almost completely melted, then continue stirring until the melting is complete.  If you don't have a microwave, use a double boiler.",1 pound Chocolate

It's sold with either large or small curds, and with fruit or chives sometimes added. Use it within a few days after purchasing and discard if mold appears. It's best served chilled. To make 2 cups (one pound), heat a gallon of skim milk to 80ºF (27ºC) using a double boiler (don't use aluminum or cast iron). Dissolve 1/4 tablet of rennet in a few tablespoons of cold water, then stir it into the milk using a whisk for a few minutes. Turn off the heat, cover, and let the mixture sit for about five hours at room temperature.  Use a knife to cut the curds into half-inch cubes, then let them sit for about 15 minutes more. 
Put the double boiler on the stove and gradually bring the temperature of the cheese to 100ºF (38ºC) (it should take about 30 minutes to reach that temperature), and then up to 115ºF (46ºC) (this should take another 15 minutes).  Hold it at this temperature for another 30 minutes.  Be sure to raise the temperature gradually, or the curds will be hard and rubbery.  Stir the mixture while it cooks, more if want small curds, less if you want big curds.  Pour the mixture into a cheesecloth-lined colander and drain off the whey for a few minutes.  Fill a sink with ice cold water.  Pulling together the edges of the cheesecloth, dunk the curds in the water for a few minutes, then put the cheesecloth-wrapped curds back in the colander to drain.  (Don't rinse the curds as long if you want your cottage cheese to have a sharper flavor.)   If you like, stir in a teaspoon salt and 1/3 cup of cream, milk, or sour cream.",1 pound cottage cheese

Some people soak them in water first to leech out some of the salt.  Mold often forms on country hams, but it's harmless and should simply be scrubbed off.

cream,1 cup evaporated milk,"The category is: Milk & Cream. Creams vary according to the amount of butterfat they have. Lightest of all is half & half, which is half milk, half cream and weighs in with a butterfat content between 10.5 - 18%.  It can't be whipped, but it's nice with coffee, or on cereal.  Light cream = coffee cream = table cream is richer at 18 - 30% fat, but it still can't be whipped.  Light whipping cream = whipping cream (with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (with at least 36% fat) are heavy enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required to get whipped cream.

Sulfur dioxide is sometimes added to the fruit to improve its shelf life and color.  If you're allergic to it, you can usually find unsulfured dried fruit at health food stores.

honey,1 cup liquid honey,"The category is: Honey. This is a thick liquid sweetener that's produced by bees from the nectar of flowers. There are over 300 kinds of honey, most of them named after the principal nectar source (e.g., clover honey, eucalyptus honey). These varieties range in color from almost white to amber to dark brown. As a rule of thumb, the lighter the color of the honey, the milder the flavor.You shouldn't feed honey to babies younger than one year--it could cause infant botulism. Store honey in a cool, dark place, where it will keep almost indefinitely. If the honey crystallizes, heat it briefly in a pan of hot water or in the microwave.Because the production of honey exploits bees, many vegetarians and vegans refuse to eat it.Popular varieties:Alfalfa honey is a very popular light and mild honey, great for baking or table use.Basswood honey is light in color, but it has a fairly strong flavor.Buckwheat honey is very dark and bold-flavored, so it's not well suited to baking.Clover honey is America's most popular honey, very mild and fine-flavored.Eucalyptus honey, popular in Australia, has a somewhat bold and slightly medicinal flavor.Orange blossom honey is an excellent, mild honey with a delicate flowery flavor.Sage honey is almost white in color, with a mild flavor.Tulip poplar honey is dark, yet mild-tasting.Tupelo honey is highly prized for its distinctive mild flavor; it's also relatively expensive.Wildflower honey has a fairly strong flavor.",1 cup honey

horseradish (prepared),1 teaspoon Salt + 2 cups horseradish grated + 1 cup vinegar,"The category is: European condiments. This pungent condiment goes well with meats and fish, and it’s a key ingredient in cocktail sauce. It’s best to buy horseradish in small amounts and store it in the refrigerator—it turns dark and loses much of its bite after a few months. Look for it in the deli case. Varieties: The most common is white horseradish, which is made with vinegar. Creamed horseradish = cream-style horseradish has a little mayonnaise and/or sour cream added; horseradish sauce has a lot. Red horseradish = beet horseradish is made with beet juice. When exposed to air, the flesh of the horseradish root begins an enzymatic reaction that causes it to become increasingly pungent within the first few minutes, and then milder after that.  Adding a sour liquid stops the reaction and locks in the heat for several months.  If you’re making your own white horseradish, make sure your kitchen is well ventilated, wear rubber gloves, and avoid touching your eyes.  Begin by preparing a sour liquid solution of one cup vinegar and one teaspoon salt.  Next, peel a horseradish root, chop it into small pieces, and grind it in a blender, adding just enough water to enable the blade to turn freely.  To make a mild sauce, immediately mix in ½ cup of the vinegar solution for each cup of grated horseradish root.  To make the sauce hotter, add the solution after a few minutes when the pungency is peaking.  Refrigerate or freeze until ready to use.",2 cups horseradish (prepared)

kosher salt,1 teaspoon pickling salt,"The category is: Salt. This salt was developed for the preparation of kosher meats, but many cooks prefer it over table salt.  It has coarser grains, so it's easier to use if you, like professional chefs, toss salt into pots with your fingers, measuring by touch.  Most kosher salt is also flaked, giving each grain a larger surface area.  This helps the salt adhere better, so it's great for lining margarita glasses, and for making a salt crust on meats or fish. Kosher salt also is preferred over table salt for canning and pickling.  Like pickling salt, kosher salt is free of iodine, which can react adversely with certain foods.  Some brands of kosher salt contain yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent, but unlike the anti-caking additive in table salt, it doesn't cloud pickling liquids.  The only drawback to using kosher salt for pickling or canning is that the grains are coarser and flakier, and can't be packed as tightly into a measuring cup as pickling salt.  This raises the risk that the salt won't be properly measured. To get around this problem, measure by weight instead of volume.  With its large grains, kosher salt isn't a good choice for baking.  Look for boxes of it in the spice section of your supermarket.",1 teaspoon kosher salt

pectin,1 cup gelatin,"The category is: Other Thickeners. In order to make preserves like jams and jellies, you normally cook together fruit, acid, sugar, and pectin, a substance found in certain fruits that gels when heated.  Some fruits -- like quinces, gooseberries, tart apples, and sour plums -- contain enough natural pectin that they'll thicken all by themselves into preserves.  Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra boost to firm up.  Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.  The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to use, and it's not a good idea to substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas.  Some brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar Recipes) need acid and just a little sugar to set, some (like Pomona's Universal Pectin® or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit Pectin®) don't need any sugar to set.

pickling salt,1 teaspoon kosher salt,"The category is: Salt. This is similar to table salt, but lacks the iodine and anti-caking additives that turn pickles dark and the pickling liquid cloudy.  Pickles made with table salt would still be good to eat, but they wouldn't look as appetizing.   Pickling salt is available in large bags or boxes in supermarkets, but it's hard to find in cities.  In addition to pickling or canning with it, you can also use pickling salt just as you would ordinary table salt, though without the anti-caking agents it may get lumpy if exposed to moisture.  To prevent lumps, put a few grains of rice in your salt shaker.  To get rid of lumps, spread the salt on a cookie sheet and bake in an oven.  Don't substitute reduced-sodium salt for pickling salt when making pickles. Since it's not as dense as pickling salt, you'll need to use more, but how much more varies by brand.  1 cup + 2 tablespoons of Morton Kosher Salt = 1 cup Morton Canning & Pickling Salt.  For other brands, it's best to measure by weight rather than volume.",1 teaspoon pickling salt

Rice is classified mostly by the size of the grain. Long-grain rice is long and slender. The grains stay separate and fluffy after cooking, so this is the best choice if you want to serve rice as a side dish, or as a bed for sauces. Medium-grain rice is shorter and plumper, and works well in paella and risotto.   Short-grain rice is almost round, with moist grains that stick together when cooked. It's the best choice for rice pudding and molded salads.  Other specialty varieties include Spanish rice for paella, glutinous rice for sushi and rice balls, and risotto rice for risotto. Most varieties are sold as either brown or white rice, depending upon how they are milled.   Brown rice retains the bran that surrounds the kernel, making it chewier, nuttier, and richer in nutrients.   White rice lacks the bran and germ, but is more tender and delicate. It's less nutritious than brown rice, but you can partially compensate for that by getting enriched white rice. Brown rice takes about twice as long to cook as white rice. Converted rice is beige. It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients. Instant rice is white rice that's been precooked and dehydrated. It's convenient, but expensive and bland.",1 cup Rice

saffron,4 tablespoons turmeric,"The category is: Global Spices. To make a pound of saffron, over two hundred thousand stigmas from crocus sativus flowers must be harvested by hand. That's why saffron is the world's most expensive spice, and also why so there are so many fakes on the market. Fortunately, a little of the good stuff goes a long way--it only takes a few threads to add saffron's distinct yellow color and earthy aroma to a family meal of paella or bouillabaisse. You can buy saffron either as as unprocessed stigmas (called saffron threads) or powdered. The threads should be red with orange tips. Threads lacking orange tips may be dyed, so avoid them. The quality of powdered saffron is measured by its Minimum Coloring Strength. The higher the Minimum Coloring Strength, the less saffron you need to use. A typical level is 180, and a level of 220 or higher is quite good. Some cooks prefer the threads to the powder, since it's hard to detect if the powder has been adulterated. Powdered saffron, though, is easier to use, since it can be added directly to a dish, while the threads need to be steeped in hot water first. for color, not flavor; use 4 times as much",1 tablespoon saffron

Salt,1 teaspoon lemon zest,"The category is: Salt. Most recipes that call for salt are referring to table salt, which has additives like iodine (to prevent a thyroid disease), and an anti-caking agent so the salt won't get lumpy in humid weather.

Exotic salts include the expensive French and Hawaiian sea salts, the smoky, sulfuric Indian black salt, and the intensely salty Korean bamboo salt. Specialized salts include pickling salt, which is free of the additives that turn pickles dark and the pickling liquid cloudy, and rock salt, used primarily to de-ice driveways and make ice cream.

Starch thickeners,1 cup roux,"The category is: Starch Thickeners. Notes: These silky powders are used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. They're popular because they thicken without adding fat or much flavor.
To avoid lumps, mix the starch with an equal amount of cold liquid until it forms a paste, then whisk it into the liquid you're trying to thicken. Once the thickener is added, cook it briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Don't overcook--liquids thickened with some starches will thin again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature.
Cornstarch, arrowroot, and tapioca are the most popular starch thickeners. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's a good idea to stock all three in your pantry.
Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or sauce. If you want high gloss, choose tapioca or arrowroot. If you want low gloss, choose cornstarch.
Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based sauces. Arrowroot becomes slimy when mixed with milk products.
Choose arrowroot if you're thickening an acidic liquid.  Cornstarch loses potency when mixed with acids.
Sauces made with cornstarch turn spongy when they're frozen. If you plan to freeze a dish, use tapioca starch or arrowroot as a thickener. 
Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish, although they can impart a starchy flavor if they're undercooked. If you worried that your thickener will mask delicate flavors in your dish, choose arrowroot. It's the most neutral tasting of the starch thickeners.

Table salt also contains small amounts of calcium silicate, an anti-caking agent, and dextrose, a stabilizer.  The anti-caking agent in both iodized and non-iodized salt doesn't dissolve in water, so if you pickle or can with it, it will turn the liquid cloudy or else settle on the bottom of the jar.  The preserved food will taste the same, mind you, but it won't look as appealing.  This is more of a problem for pickles, which are immersed in lots of liquid, than for other canned goods. To prevent the cloudiness, use pickling salt, which contains no additives. This is more flavorful, and great for cooking. Since it's less dense, grind it first or use up to twice as much.",1 teaspoon table salt

yeast starter,2 cups flour + 2.25 teaspoons active dry yeast + 2 cups water warm,"The category is: Yeast. A starter is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients that's been colonized by wild airborne yeast and friendly bacteria.  These one-celled immigrants lend the starter--and the breads made with it--a special character.  Sourdough starter, for example, contains a strain of yeast that's tolerant of the lactic and acetic acids produced by the lactobacilli.  Those acids give sourdough bread its characteristic tang.  The French use a soupy starter called a poolish to make their breads, while the Italians use a thicker one called a biga.  Up until the late 19th century, all yeast breads were leavened with starters, and keeping a starter alive in its crock was a routine household chore.  To keep your own starter alive, wait until it's established, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  To keep it healthy, bring it to room temperature once a week and remove all but about 25% of it (either make bread with it or discard it).  Replace what you've taken with a mixture of equal parts warm water and flour, stir, then return it to the refrigerator.  Properly maintained, a starter can last for decades, developing an ever more distinctive character as it ages.   To use a starter to make bread, remove some of it (usually about 2 cups), and use it in place of other forms of yeast.  Replace the amount you took with a mixture of equal parts flour and warm water.  Discard your starter if it becomes orange or pink, or if it develops an unpleasant odor.   It's easy to make starters from scratch, but even easier to borrow some from a friend.  Since sourdough starters must be colonized by strains of yeast and lactobacilli that are particular to certain regions (like San Francisco), a homemade starter might not yield sour bread.   Your best bet is to get a powdered sourdough starter mix from your supermarket or a mail order supplier. Sprinkle 1 package of active dry yeast on 2 cups of warm water, wait 10 minutes, then stir in 2 cups of flour.  Cover loosely, and let the mixture sit at about 85°.",1 teaspoon yeast starter
